Please read the following rules that the access control list (ACL) needs to follow in order to be valid:
- The start of lines in the ACL is considered the first instance of text, and is indexed at 0
- There are two types of statements: permit or deny 
	-These can be followed by the word 'any' or an ip address x.x.x.x (x = a number between 0 and 255)
	-Currently only implemented for 192.168.1.x addresses (though can work for any address scheme)
	-Wildcards not implemented
-Each line needs to have a separate rule

Other Notes:
-Deny is by default BUT if you deny addresses specifically, those will be the only denied addresses and the acl will not deny by default
	-Please see examples of this in acl/
-When the ACL is run, the permitted addresses will be allowed, followed by the denied addresses
	-This is because the ACL is allowing the permitted addresses first so there is no interuption of network communication
	-This means there are essentially two DFA: one for permitted addresses and one for denied addresses(the later is ran second)
-A simulated network stream of source IP addresses will be read in to show that the DFA enforces the specified ACL
	-Examples are found in streams/ and should be used to see the DFA work
